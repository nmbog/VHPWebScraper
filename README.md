# VHPWebScraper
I recently started interning with the VA's DME team, and the 'Veteran of the Day' initiative is a very important part of the internship. 
The VA takes nominations from the public, but also often pulls from the 'Veteran's History Project'. Leadership asked if there was a way 
to pull names from the Veteran's History Project, so there would be a master list of those names to potentially use for Veteran of the Day. 
I built this web scraper as an answer to that question.
